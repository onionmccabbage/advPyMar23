 6-9 March 2023
 Toby Dussek

All my code will be here:
  https://github.com/onionmccabbage/advPyMar23

9:30 start
11:00 coffee
12:30 lunch
3:00 tea
4:30 end

- you will need: a copy of Python 3.x (real or virtual)
- an editor: VS Code, PyCharm, Spyder etc...
- internet, able to install python libraries (e.g. requests library)

Python code lives in classes or in functions, in modules, which live in packages (folders)

Monday
- intro and welcome
  - what do you currently know
  - what do you want to know
- abstract and concrete classes
- name mangled members
- if __name__== '__main__': revisited
- using decorators
- functional programming: map, filter and reduce
- Loading local and remote data (requests)
- after lunch review
- instrinsics
- comprehensions, generators and yield

Tuesday
- functional programming: parameters
- processing text/json
  - json.loads() takes JSON and returns Python structure
  - json.dumps() takes Python structure and returns JSON
- persisting files: read/write/append/exclusive/overwrite, text, bytes, json
- databases
  see https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseProgramming
- other db connections
- Create, Read and Update (and DELETE) - CRUD operations
- populate db with sample data
- read and nicely format values from the db
- explore 'typicode' API as a static data source for JSON
- after lunch review exercise
  ask questions, help each other, share code (screen-share)

Wednesday
- context manager - switch context e.g. for handling data input and output
- networking server/client (microservices)
- overview of Flask
- Testing: 
  - doctest revisited
  see https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
  - unittest
- after lunch lab exercise
- pytest see https://docs.pytest.org/

Thursday
- profiling: timings etc. (cprofile)
- multithreading, also limits of mutlithreading concurrency
- the global Interpreter Lock (GIL) will affect threading performance
- join many threads: iterate oever a lsit/tuple of threads
- Python has -O to optimize code (especially usefull for threading)
- after lunch lab exercise
- logging - context mgr, often we log by time-stamp
- iter
- named tuple
- zip
- end of course feedback
